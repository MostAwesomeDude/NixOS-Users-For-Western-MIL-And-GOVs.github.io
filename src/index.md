In response to [Open Letter against MIC sponsorship](https://nixos-users-against-mic-sponsorship.github.io/).

In recent years, many tech workers with good intentions have loudly pushed for what they believe to be right inside of their companies, and in the open-source ecosystem in the same fashion, it is now being pushed against the NixOS Foundation. 

Many who are not as vocal were assuming good faith as passive bystanders even when disagreeing, but what once could have been seen as good-hearted naive ideology with current geopolitical development doesn't allow for passive bystander ignorance anymore and requires to be an active voice of reason.

For many years, tech was declining to work with Western governments, military branches, or private defence companies, protesting and shaming anyone who did. Currently, western hegemony is under question by authoritarian regimes all around the globe. 
Western elites and many tech workers shake even when such wording as Western hegemony or Western supremacy is being used as something worthwhile to pursue and maintain, but all achievements we take for granted, such as:
- human rights
- freedom of speech
- individual liberties
- women's rights
- democratic society
- equality
- the rule of law
- private property


And many more are NOT given at all. 


Facade democracies and wanna-be dictators are waking up to the possibility of Western hegemony's death. As much as we all like to think the soft power of our values and words is shaping reality, hard power in the form of advanced weapon systems backed by rich Western economies and talented western workforce is a hard requirement as well. 

We cannot keep playing social virtue signaling games and allow ourselves to maintain naive worldviews anymore. If we really care about humanity's well-being we have to make sure the achievement of the free world doesn't diminish as the first victims of it would be people who are far away from Western strength protection. 
Everyone who experienced alternatives to the Western empire in the form of any other empire can testify to this. 


## To the Foundation

We ask you to think deeply about what's right and what are the long-term consequences of your decisions beyond Public Relations. The loud activists may be a bigger crowd, but loud doesn't mean right. Think about real people paying the price in blood and their freedom if we as the tech workforce won't finally come to the reason to support our own nations' army, governments and defense companies simply to avoid a bit of a hate on Twitter.
Is what's right a function of online hate or lack of it? 

We are asking the NixOS Foundation to take a strong stance against being pushed around as an example to other open source projects and tech leadership. This is an issue across a whole tech sector much bigger than the NixOS Foundation itself. 

We sympathize with the responsibility brought onto you unasked, started by a random German university rules, and hope you can bear it and do the right thing.

We, as the West are healing, from many of our historical mistakes, the most clearly seen in Germany's ultra pacifism or American racial history which needs healing.

We have to heal as naive child-like avoidance can no longer be a solution, but rational voice and trauma healing are a must to go forward and support our values and what maintains them. 

We believe NixOS foundation members believe in Western values system of freedom and individuals rights, and would want for them to be maintained wordwide.
